# ES6-LearningJourney
# First thing I want to clear that I'm a self taught programmer and learner and I did't waste my single penny to buy an courses and tutorial.
1.First of all I'm beginning in my journey to learn JS. I only know's the Basics or JS.
2.Scrimba is a great practical intoduction of JS. I took this tutorial when I made a lot of atempts to learn DOM. only i want to say that if you have clear view about basics of JS so this tutorial is great and most powerful to learn DOM through a practical way.
